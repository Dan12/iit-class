infix to postfix:
numbers are in the same order that they appear in expression
emit operands in terms of order of precendence
    - 2 * (3 + 2 + 1) + 3 * 2
    - 2 3 2 1 + + * 3 2 * +
    - push *
    - open parense higher order of precendence, push (
    - push +
    - push +
    - close parense, pop until (
    - + is lower than *, pop * and push +
    - * is higher than +, emit *
    - at the end, pop all remaining
    
maze solving:
decends very deep
backtracks to previous decision
depth first search
goes very deep before figuring out it is wrong
stack is a depth first search approach

alternate approach:
can try and cast a wide net
need a first in first out data storage
queue:
    - first in first out data structure
    - get in at end, get out at front
    - enqueue and dequeue
    - dequeue from the head
    - enqueue onto the tail
breadth first search, casting a broad net
