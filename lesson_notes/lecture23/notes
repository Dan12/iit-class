Binary tree
    -heap structure is a binary tree, used an array
    -want total ordering and maintain the order efficientely
    -need to use heirarchical data structure
    -the structure is defined recursively
    -root node is empty or contains a value and has references to a left and right sub tree
    -a tree can be none/empty
Binary search tree
    -implement binary search outside of an array/list
    -value at every node is greater than all values in the left subtree and less than the values in the right subtree
    -empty tree is binary search tree
    -can't use array backed implementation: not complete tree, 
    -good idea, but if they are not balanced they don't give the time complexity we want
    -balanced tree has same find time complexity as binary search
    -traverse the tree: stack or queue to remember where you have been
    -can replace stacks and queues with recursion (careful with stack overflowing)
