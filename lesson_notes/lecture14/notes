numbers are objects in python
lists contain references to other objects
isinstance(f, Foo)
    - is instace of class and super classes
    
linked lists
    - seperate individual linked together storage mechanism
    - create tree with left and right
        - [ , 'A' , ]
           v       V
        [  ,B, ]  [ ,'B', ]
    - free to put new link in chain anywhere with constant time
    
    - Class node, inside linked list, clearly part of linked list class
    - Node class: value and next attirbute
    - Prepend time complexity: O(1)
    - Append time complexity: O(n)
    - Need to find end of list
    
Circular List
     - tail.next equal to head
     - head always refer to last node as prior
     - eliminate edge cases with sentinal node
