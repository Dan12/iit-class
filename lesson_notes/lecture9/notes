algorithms and time complexity
    -dictionary search time: constant search time, independant of number of items in dictionry
    -list search time: linear search time, linear relationship between number of items in list and search time
    -Time(N) is T(N) = time to search through list of size N
    -Time complexity: relationship between time it take to process number of elements
    -Assuming that indexing from lists is constant
binary search
    -eliminate as much of search domain as possible
    -logarithmic time
