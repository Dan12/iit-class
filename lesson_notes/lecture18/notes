Queues
-Schedualing Jobs
-First in, First out
-Round robin schedualing, predicated by behavior of the queue
-The data strucutre determines the order of the data structure
-OS is dolling out work to processors, schedualing algorithm


-Priority Queues
-Before stack and queue, sequential data strucutres imposed a total ordering on their elements,
    -Every element has a predetermined position
-Stacks and Queues restrict the API, but internal ordering doesn't matter, no total ordering
-Middle ground to restrict API and impose a different type of ordering
-Priority Queue: everything that goes into the queue has a priority
    -Everything goes in and then goes out in terms of their priority
    -Things that have the highest priority get dueued first
